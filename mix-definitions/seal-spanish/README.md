# Spanish Mix (Scale.ai Leaderboard)

This mix is based on the top models ranked for Spanish by Scale.ai's SEAL leaderboard. The weight is a function of the Elo score.

The evaluation process involves assessing model responses across three main dimensions: honesty (understanding and consistency), accuracy (correctness of claims), and helpfulness (instruction following and writing quality). Models are paired against each other and evaluated on these criteria, with a focus on instruction following abilities.

The top-performing models in the Spanish leaderboard are GPT-4o in first place, followed by Gemini 1.5 Pro (May 2024) in second, and GPT-4 Turbo Preview in third.

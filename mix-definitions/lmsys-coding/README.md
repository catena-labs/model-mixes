# LMSys Coding Leaderboard Mix

Don't worry about staying up to date with the latest coding model to use in your favorite IDE. This mix is based on the top coding models ranked in the LMSys Chatbot Arena for the Coding category. The weight is a function of the Elo score adjusted for number of votes and variance. Models with more consistently high votes will be weighed more heavily.

Note: `o1-mini` and `o1-preview` are not included in this mix because they do not support system prompts and other parameters.

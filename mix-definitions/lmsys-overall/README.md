# LMSys Overall Leaderboard

This mix is based on the top models ranked in the LMSys Chatbot Arena for the Overall category. The weight is a function of the Elo score adjusted for number of votes and variance. Models with more consistently high votes will be weighed more heavily.

Note: `o1-mini` and `o1-preview` are not included in this mix because they do not support system prompts and other parameters.
